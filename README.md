# Documentation

- How did you decide to use that design and architectural patterns?

I chose to use the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design and architectural pattern for my Gaming Center Mobile App because it separates the user interface from the business logic, allowing for a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. MVVM also facilitates easier testing and improves the overall structure of the app, making it a great choice for this iOS developer case study.
- What should be the part of this app that needs more time to develop or improve?

Currently, users can see basic information such as genre and metacritic score, but adding more detailed information, including screenshots, trailers, and in-depth reviews, would enhance the user experience and make the app even more valuable for video game enthusiasts.
- Which part did you like most in this app?

The ability to search for video games by title is a key feature that allows users to quickly find the games they're interested in, making the app more user-friendly and efficient. 
- Does this app ready to submit to store? If not, what should be done to achieve that?

App may not be ready for release on the app store yet, as there may still be some areas for improvement with regards to design and user experience. 
- Do you have any comments to us?

 Task documentation was not much clear regarding what was optional and what was mandatory. This caused some confusion and made it harder to complete the project effectively.
- What are the things you think are missing or open in this assignment?

While including unit tests is a best practice in software development, the limited time available for this project may have made it difficult to incorporate them.
